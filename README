opium: OSCARified User Synchronisation System

The OSCAR User Synchronization System keeps the users
and groups synchronized from the the central OSCAR server out to the
OSCAR compute nodes. OPIUM is compatible with the Pluggable Authentification
Modules (PAM) mechanism (NIS, NIS+, LDAP, ...). The users and groups on 
the OSCAR server are checked and synchronized (if necessary) periodically 
(configurable).  The opium package now uses the sync_files package to do all 
synchronization.
